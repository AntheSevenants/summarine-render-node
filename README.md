# summarine-render-node
Node JS-based rendering for my personal notes

In 2017, I built my own program for taking notes. Ever since, I have used this program to write course notes and make summaries. To bring full transparency to my research process, I built this server-side rendering script which allows me to export my notes to standard HTML. In this way, everyone can read the notes I take for my PhD research.

Currently, only a fraction of the functionality of my notes program has been ported to this version. However, for my current research notes, the implemented functionality should suffice.

Bear in mind that this repository only contains the *renderer* for my notes, not the notes themselves.
